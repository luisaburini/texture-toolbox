# texture-toolbox

This repository has the purpose to extract statistical measures about a 2D or 3D image and run pattern recognition analisys in order to identify and characterize regions of interest.

First of all, the image statistics are obtained through the image histogram, presented in the histogram.ipynb. Then, the statistical features are obtained in histstat.ipynb
