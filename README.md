# texture-toolbox

This repository has the purpose to extract statistical measures about a 2D or 3D image and run pattern recognition analisys in order to identify and characterize regions of interest.

First of all, the image statistics are obtained through the image histogram, presented in the histogram.ipynb. Then, the statistical features are obtained in histstat.ipynb

The files above where made to me used in the jupyter-notebook platform. The user is strongly advised to install such platform and run them in the cited environment.
